Hello I'm Daniel,

I am currently learning Python for Data Science. I have a history in the liquor industry and would love the opportunity to get back into that industry as a Data Scientist/Analyist.
I have completed 4 Edx courses through Georgia Tech and plan to take their OMSA program next year.
I'm slowly learning how to create projects and show everyone what I have learned.

I'm open to communicating with both experienced and inexperienced Data Scientists/Analyists. Feel free to reach me on my LinkedIn.
